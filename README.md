Project: Antonio Rice's Resume

This is my first jab at coding. I've dabbled with HTML aand CSS before during Code Academy's beginners class, but never completed a project, until now. 

All code was written by yours truly, with the help of a few slides from Code Academy and the greatest teacher of all, Youtube.

This project was submitted along with my application to Prime Academy. Hopefully they love it enough to accept me into their Full Stack Engineering program. It has been a long time dream of mine to become a developer and I finally took the leap.

Thank you all for checking out my first ever web page. I had so much fun with it over the last 2 days. Please feel free to dig through the code and give me some pointers! All constructive feed back is welcome!
